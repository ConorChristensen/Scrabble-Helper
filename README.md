Python Scrabble Helper
Program completed in python.

In order to aid a game of scrabble, a dictionary must be used to find the largest group of anagrams existing within the dictionary.
Additionally, the dictionary must be able to be searched for anagrams of a user inputted word, along side with all anagrams that also
inclue a wildcard, or blank tile.

Scrabble Helper.py uses a hash table to read in all words from a dictionary, and initially outputs the largest group of anagrams foudn in
the dictionary. The program then goes on to ask for user input as to provide a query word to search. The program then outputs all found
anagrmas of this word from the dictionary, including all found anagrams of the word + a-blank-tile.
